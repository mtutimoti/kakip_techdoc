There have been several \u0026amp;ldquo;AI booms\u0026amp;rdquo; in the past, but both hardware and software for advanced processing were not yet ready for practical use. Now that the global Internet environment has improved and hardware performance has evolved dramatically due to the high integration of IC chips, AI processing has begun to be implemented in society at a different pace than in the past. In such a situation, one of the challenges is to make robots intelligent, and edge AI processing (especially image processing) is important for robots to operate autonomously in the field.\nRobots need to operate motors and actuators in real time while processing information from many sensors and cameras.\nKakip started its development with the objective of taking charge of high-performance AI image processing in isolation from the host. Kakip will be released first as a single board computer that can be easily handled for research and development of robotic computing, and in the future will be developed into a board product suitable for various embedded applications.\nAbout Kakip logo mark Although single-board computer products have been actively developed worldwide in recent years, there are unfortunately very few products originating from Japan. As we started to develop products with high-performance AI functions from Japan, we learned that “Kaki”, Japanese fruit name of persimmon, is one of the domestically produced fruits that have been exported to the world in a remarkably increasing volume, although in a different field. The logo was designed with a motif of a persimmon superimposed on a picture of a neural network, and was completed with the idea of going out into the world just as much as the persimmon. The development team had nicknamed this processor board \u0026amp;ldquo;Kakip,\u0026amp;rdquo; and we hoped that the endearing name would make it familiar to everyone.\n","date":1722211200,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-29T00:00:00Z","objectID":"6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","publishdate":"2024-07-29T00:00:00Z","title":"About Kakip"},{"content":"Kakip is based on the Renesas RZ/V2H processor.

Originally developed to reduce the complexity and cost of electrical wiring in automobiles through multiplexing, the CAN bus protocol has since been adopted in various other contexts. This broadcast-based, message-oriented protocol ensures data integrity and prioritization through a process called arbitration, allowing the highest priority device to continue transmitting if multiple devices attempt to send data simultaneously, while others back off. Its reliability is enhanced by differential signaling, which mitigates electrical noise. Common versions of the CAN protocol include CAN 2.0, CAN FD, and CAN XL which vary in their data rate capabilities and maximum data payload sizes.\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"f7637bf9ec637441cfcf46aedae6261b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter3/chapter3-5/1/1/","title":"3.5.1 What is CAN?"},{"content":"The CAN bus follows a standardized protocol that allows the network to address data and commands where needed. Between transmissions, the bus is in an idle state at the recessive voltage level. The start of the transmission frame (SOF) is marked by the transmission of a dominant bit. A message identifier in the next field is followed by a remote transmission request (RTR)—which indicates whether the frame contains data or is requesting data. These two fields are used to establish message priority and arbitrate access to the bus. The Control Field contains the length of the following data field. The data field can have up to eight data bytes in classic CAN. If data is being transmitted (data frame), then the data field is followed by the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) which is used to check for transmission errors. At this point, the driver puts the bus into a recessive state so the receiver can acknowledge (ACK) successful receipt by asserting a dominant state. The ACK bit is surrounded by delimiter bits on each side. After the ACK bit, the controller sends a seven-bit end-of-frame (EOF) message followed by a seven-bit interframe spacing, marking the minimum time before another frame can be transmitted. If the bit sequence contains five or more bits of the same state, then the controller will insert a stuff bit of the opposite state to ensure that there are sufficient edges in the signal to maintain synchronization. These stuff bits are removed by the receiver so that the data content is correct. After the CRC field, bit stuffing is deactivated to ensure that the ACK and EOF fields do not show stuff bits.\n","date":1721174400,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-17T00:00:00Z","objectID":"281b702227e93f78c651eb28bb365dd5","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter3/chapter3-5/2/2/","publishdate":"2024-07-17T00:00:00Z","title":"3.5.2 Protocol"},{"content":"","date":1721174400,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-17T00:00:00Z","objectID":"d5446e009f7a663aa2c11546a0148663","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter3/chapter3-5/","publishdate":"2024-07-17T00:00:00Z","title":"3.5 CAN"},{"content":"","date":1721347200,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","objectID":"89a057afe085f55c8d799ebb2a3256d3","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter4/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","title":"4 Option"},{"content":"It is equipped with MAXIM’s MAX9296AGTM/V+, a dual GMSL2/GMSL1 to CSI-2 deserializer.\n","date":1721347200,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","objectID":"e6e534ca7271b8ef25222411268ddfb2","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter4/chapter4-1/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","title":"4.1 GMSL2 HAT"},{"content":"","date":1721347200,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","objectID":"1b108db89b3d33a9667aafbe5881f6b3","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter4/chapter4-1/chapter4-1-1/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","title":"4.1.1 Specifications"},{"content":"","date":1721347200,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","objectID":"eb6713ccb36b7e8d2499d94fcd902d6b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter5/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","title":"5 Third party"},{"content":"Sony STARVIS IMX462 Ultra Low-Light Multi-Camera Solution for Renesas RZ/V2H\nHighlights Houses Full HD Sony Starvis Camera Module with S-mount lens holder Ultra low light performance Plugs directly into the Renesas RZ/V2H development kit On-board high performance ISP Multicamera support for RZ/V2H (upto 4 cameras) ","date":1721347200,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","objectID":"7ee28da6e7fbcf54d56d6bebb48e9df2","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter5/chapter5-1/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","title":"5.1 e-CAM22_CURZH"},{"content":"Key features: Frame Rate: Streams HD @ 60 fps \u0026amp;amp; Full HD @ 60 fps Output format: Uncompressed UYVY streaming High speed 4-lane MIPI CSI-2 interface Standard M12 lens holder for use with customized optics or lenses for various applications Lightweight, versatile, and portable design Interface: Interface: 4-Lane MIPI CSI-2 Connector: 22pin FPC connector Cable length: 15cm Module features: Sensor: IMX462 from Sony® Starvis Focus Type: Fixed focus Sensor Resolution: Full HD Chroma: Color Optical Format: 1/ 2.8\u0026amp;quot; Output Format: Uncompressed UYVY Pixel Size: : 2.9 μm x 2.9 μm Sensor Active Area: 1920H x 1080V G Sensitivity: 2376mV for HCG mode; 921mV for LCG mode Holder: M12 (S-Mount) FOV: 132°(D), 113°(H), 61°(V) (with the lens provided by e-con) Electrical and Mechanical: Operating voltage: 3.3V +/- 5% Operating temperature: -30°C to 70°C Typical power consumption - TBD Size in mm (l x b): 30 x 30 mm Miscellaneous: Compliance: RoHS ","date":1721347200,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","objectID":"2e49977982f0e968dad97805f9e5c341","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter5/chapter5-1/chapter5-1-1/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","title":"5.1.1 Specifications"},{"content":"","date":1721347200,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","objectID":"daa948eb7be6f8db0deee72e6ef161ec","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter6/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","title":"6 Others"},{"content":"","date":1721347200,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","objectID":"138e8ddbb3cf58ab0194151335716317","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter6/chapter6-1/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","title":"6.1 Certifications and export control"},{"content":"HS: 8471504090 US HS: 8543708800 UPC: 640265311062 EU HS: 8471707000 COO: CHINA\n","date":1721347200,"description":"","lastmod":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","objectID":"1d052461e0af2f8dc824a927f4576220","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/chapter6/chapter6-1/chapter6-1-1/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T00:00:00Z","title":"6.1.1 Export designations"}]
