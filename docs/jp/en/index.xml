      <description>Why we developed Kakip. There have been several &amp;ldquo;AI booms&amp;rdquo; in the past, but both hardware and software for advanced processing were not yet ready for practical use. Now that the global Internet environment has improved and hardware performance has evolved dramatically due to the high integration of IC chips, AI processing has begun to be implemented in society at a different pace than in the past. In such a situation, one of the challenges is to make robots intelligent, and edge AI processing (especially image processing) is important for robots to operate autonomously in the field.</description>
